## Prerequisites

- Install https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi
- Add this folder to your PATH

## Flow

Fork the project, you will only work on your own fork.

Open a new Github Issue (for bugfix, feature request, ...)

    gi open "Feature XY is required to do Z"

This creates a new Github issue and checkouts a new issue branch.
All commits for the feature go into this issue branch. Once your
Feature is ready:

    gi push

Now you're ready to create a new pull request:

    gi pull-request

Open the pull request in your browser and make sure via comments that
another contributor reviews the PR and finally merges it. You can use a 
shortcut to open the browser:

    gi browse

That's it!
